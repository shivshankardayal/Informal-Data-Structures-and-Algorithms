  <d:title>Recursion</d:title>
  <d:para>
    In this chapter we will study recursion. Recursion is such a powerful
    concept that it requires its own chapter. Usually, beginners find it hard
    to understand recursion. We will study several problems and their solutions
    to foster the concept of recursion. We will also study advantages and
    disadvantages of recursion. I have already discussed recursion in small
    detail <d:link xlink:href="/c/func/#idp51865936">here</d:link>. Usually,
    beginners do not understand recursion because they do not understand how
    the stack(not the data structure but the stack of a process in memory)
    works. Once you understand how it works it is very easy to understand
    recursion. I will tread recursion in much greater depth here than what was
    presented in C programming book.

    Formally, we can say that a definition, which defines an object in terms of
    simpler case of itself is recursive definition.
